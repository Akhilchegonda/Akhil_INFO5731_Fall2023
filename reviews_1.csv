8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Very accurate",I like this blood pressure because it goes by the arm and not the wrist. It’s easy to work. It got good ratings on the top ten. I’m very pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor.

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor.

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor.

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.

So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor.

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.

The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor.

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Very accurate","I like that it is accurate, as measured against the Doctor’s blood pressure cuff.What is a bit of a problem is that when you turn it on the measurement goes all the way up to 190 before itstarts dropping down for the reading.  So it gets extremely tight and uncomfortable for the first few seconds.  I almost returned it but decided to keep it for the accuracy.  Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Eklderly or sensitive people might have a problem with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

Outstanding Performance and Accuracy","I've recently purchased the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.Accuracy is vital when it comes to blood pressure monitors and this device delivers just that. Each reading I've taken has been consistent and reliable, giving me an ample amount of trust in this device. The adjustable cuff is a thoughtful addition, making it highly suitable for a variety of users.The large backlit display is another feature I find extremely useful. The bold, clear numbers make the readings easy to read and comprehend, even in low light conditions.But what sets the Konquest Blood Pressure Monitor apart is its user-friendly design. It's quick to set up and effortless to use.I highly recommend the Konquest Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor. It truly combines quality, comfort and functionality in one device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

8 months of use - good read- tight cuff!","I purchased this 8 months ago for my boyfriend who has high blood pressure but I began to use it more 3-4 weeks ago due to being diagnosed with preeclampsia during and after labor. My only ick is that the cuff bubbles and tightens up pretty bad sometimes, resulting in an inaccurate read. I’ve had to quickly turn it off and rerun it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1
